			<h1>Why This API</h1>
			<p>
				For the Midterm Project, my group and I make a website for a dine-in
				theater. One member of our group had to manually find and type out the movie 
				titles and descriptions for each movie we used. When this API assignment came up it 
				made me think, it would be great to just import all the movies (and descriptions) 
				from an API. Luckily one of my favorite movie studios had a free/open API.

			<h1>Two Useful Applications</h1>
			
			<ol>
				<li>This would be a helpful if you were a theater company and wanted to
				import all movies data and keep the movies descriptions and releases
				up to date.</li>
			
				<li>If you were making an app like Goodreads but for movies.
				'Goodwatches' let's call it - having access to a movie studio API
				would allow for a large database of movies for your users to choose from.
				So Studio Ghibli's API would be one of many that you would hopefully gain
				access to.
